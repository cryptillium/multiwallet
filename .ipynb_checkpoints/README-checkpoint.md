# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python


The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how HD wallets work. We will do this by using command line tool, `hd-wallet-derive` which 
supports not only BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44, but also supports non-standard derivation paths for the most popular wallets available. 

This project aims to integrated a "universal" wallet using the HD Wallet Derive tool to demonstrate how we can use it to manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins.
